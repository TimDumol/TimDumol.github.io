          <div class="content">
            <p>I love solving problems using code, math, and algorithms. I am experienced in site reliability
              engineering,
              data engineering, algorithms and programming contests, and web development. I have won
              national and international contests in algorithms &amp; data science. I'm a geek at heart, and love to
              obsess over my hobbies: baking, board games, electronics, reading, and video games.

            Helped found the National Olympiad in Informatics Philippines (NOI.PH) in 2014 and incorporate it in 2017.
            NOI.PH is the official PH qualifier for the International Olympiad in Informatics,
            the most prestigious international algorithmic programming contest at the high school level.
            NOI.PH trains the top competitors in advanced algorithms and data structures,
            and sends the top delegates to the IOI. Through our efforts,
            the PH team has received medals each year in the IOI.

          <li>Spearheaded <a href="https://www.kalibrr.com">Kalibrr's</a> effort to ingest internal data sources into a
            central BigQuery data warehouse; reducing
            analysis time in certain use cases >100x from days to minutes
          </li>
          <li>Streamlined bringing ML models into production by creating a standard Connexion-based template and Helm
            chart, improving development velocity 6x from 1 released model per year to 1 per 2 months.
          </li>
          <li>Improved process of productionizing ML models by requiring (and creating tooling for) performance
            benchmarks, Swagger/OpenAPI templates, and automated Cloud Build-based tests.
          </li>
          <li>Improved observability of ML models by incorporating error reporting, distributed tracing (via
            Opencensus/Stackdriver Trace), and Prometheus metrics in the standard Connnexion-based template.
          </li>
          <li>Implemented cost control measures for BigQuery usage through a cost dashboard and automated cost alerts on
            a per-user basis

          </li>
          <li>Reduced Kalibrr's GCP bill by 50% in a cost optimization project, mostly through benchmarking and
            right-sizing requests
          </li>
          <li>Enabled observability by setting up alerting & metrics via Prometheus & Grafana, distributed tracing via
            OpenCensus & Stackdriver Trace, and error reporting; decreasing Mean Time To Repair by making it easier to
            diagnose incidents rapidly, and making it easy to optimize hotspots by allowing deep dives into endpoint
            execution.
          </li>
          <li>Transitioned container building from Jenkins to Cloud Build, increasing reliability and parallelism for
